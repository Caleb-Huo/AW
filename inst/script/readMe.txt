This fold contains the code to generate sysdata.rda, which is the library for importance sampling.
This library (sysdata.rda) is essential for fast calculation of AW-Fisher p-value.

The order of excutation is:
1, Compile the importanceSampling.cpp to generate importanceSampling.o and importanceSampling.so (see command in importanceSampling_qunif.R).
2, Run command_qunif.sh, which essentially call importanceSampling_qunif.R and importanceSampling.so.
3, Run save.R, which will generate sysdata.rda using all the intermediate output generated by ommand_qunif.sh.

0, debug.R is for debug purpose by the maintainer.

The algorithm is described here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05084
